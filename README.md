# CIFAR-10-classifier
#### ('aeroplane'  'automobile' 'bird' 'cat' 'deer' 'dog' 'frog'  'horse'  'ship'  'truck')
i made a classifier that distinguish between 10 different class with a test accersy of 82% on unseen data.

i added the trained model and the builder and a gui.

i have made the model using colab so if you try to use it you need to update your tensorflow and keras to the latest version.

## here is a demo of how it works:
